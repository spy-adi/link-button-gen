Here’s how I would approach each of the global objectives, with examples from the work and components you've built since joining Barclays:

### 1. **Drive simplicity and efficiency, seek out every opportunity to automate**
   - **Example**: Created reusable Angular components like `app-input`, `app-dropdown`, and `app-toast` that simplified user input handling, validation, and notification displays across different modules.
   - **Example**: Developed a wrapper for `p-table` in Angular, allowing seamless integration of various custom templates without repetitive code, thus improving efficiency in data display.
   - **Example**: Built a service in `rda` for fetching and handling API data, which currently holds static data but is designed for easy API integration, ensuring future readiness.

### 2. **Focus on businesses and projects where we can excel**
   - **Example**: Focused on improving user interfaces by developing dynamic side navigation and tree nodes for a more intuitive user experience, supporting complex hierarchical data display.
   - **Example**: Improved data validation processes by transitioning from `ngModel` to reactive forms in Angular, which allowed more robust validation logic and error handling.
   - **Example**: Enhanced the audit tracking system by implementing a detailed comparison of old and new values using a `p-table` to facilitate better visibility and control over data changes.

### 3. **Have precision in our operations risk management and controls**
   - **Example**: Implemented a system where any changes made by the user (maker) are verified by another (checker), ensuring a robust check-and-balance mechanism for data modifications.
   - **Example**: Developed an audit trail feature using `p-table` that captures and displays every change, providing transparency and accountability in data handling.
   - **Example**: Created reusable validation mechanisms for input fields in Angular, reducing the risk of data entry errors and ensuring data integrity.

### 4. **Promote diversity of thought, champion new thinking and challenge the status quo**
   - **Example**: Developed a reasoning benchmark for language models, focusing on tasks like reasoning correction and web navigation, which introduced innovative ways of assessing and improving AI capabilities.
   - **Example**: Introduced new methods for handling complex data validation and rendering, like using a flexible dialog and input handling system in Angular.
   - **Example**: Suggested and implemented a dynamic approach to UI components like side navigation, allowing seamless adaptation to different user requirements.

### 5. **Provide world-class service to our customers and clients every time**
   - **Example**: Built a dynamic and user-friendly input system that improves user interaction, helping internal users to manage data more efficiently.
   - **Example**: Created a flexible dialog component for editing data, ensuring that customers’ data can be managed in a clear and efficient manner.
   - **Example**: Developed a dynamic audit tracking system that ensures accurate tracking of user activities, leading to improved client trust and satisfaction.

These examples highlight how you have quickly adapted to the work environment and actively contributed towards these global objectives since joining Barclays.
