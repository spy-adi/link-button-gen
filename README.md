### Values and Mindsets for All Colleagues
**Respect:**  
- I’ve shown respect by actively listening to feedback from peers and incorporating suggestions into the development of reusable components like `app-input` and `app-dropdown`. This has helped build a more collaborative environment and resulted in better outcomes for the team.
- When developing the `p-table` wrapper for audit data, I made sure to align with user needs, ensuring that the component was user-friendly and met accessibility standards.

**Integrity:**  
- Demonstrated integrity by ensuring transparency and accuracy in handling sensitive audit data, where old and new values need to be tracked. This involved implementing a maker-checker system and ensuring the highest standards in managing the data flow.
- Always adhered to best practices in coding and project documentation, ensuring that my work aligns with Barclays' ethical standards.

**Service:**  
- Focused on delivering solutions that provide exceptional service, like the dynamic side navigation and the `p-toast` component, which significantly improved user experience and efficiency.
- Provided proactive support to colleagues in adopting new components and frameworks, ensuring a smooth transition and better user satisfaction.

**Excellence:**  
- Consistently aimed for high standards by optimizing existing processes, such as automating validation logic using reactive forms in Angular, which has greatly improved data accuracy.
- Continuously sought ways to improve my own skills and stay updated with new technologies, ensuring that my contributions are always aligned with industry best practices.

### Lead Behaviours for Leaders
**Empower:**  
- Supported team members by sharing knowledge about creating reusable components and services, helping them to build similar components independently.
- Fostered a collaborative environment by organizing knowledge-sharing sessions on best practices in Angular development, encouraging others to adopt a more efficient and modular approach in their projects.

**Steward:**  
- Took responsibility for implementing a robust data validation mechanism, ensuring that our applications maintain a high standard of data integrity, which aligns with Barclays' goals of precision and risk management.
- Played a key role in developing controls for audit data management, making sure that changes are tracked accurately and that users are accountable for their inputs.

**Simplify:**  
- Simplified processes by building generic and reusable components like `app-input` and `app-dropdown`, allowing for easier and faster integration of new features into existing applications.
- Focused on removing redundant steps in our development process, like creating dynamic structures for side navigation that adjust automatically based on user input, making our projects more efficient and easier to maintain.

**Inspire:**  
- Encouraged my peers to think creatively and embrace new approaches, such as introducing dynamic dialog boxes with user-defined styles, to improve user interaction.
- Inspired the team to challenge existing methods by suggesting and implementing more efficient API handling processes, setting an example for continuous improvement and innovation.

These comments reflect how I have consistently worked to embody Barclays’ values and demonstrate leadership through practical actions, ensuring that my contributions align with both the company's objectives and the broader vision for continuous improvement.
