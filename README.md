### 1. **Performance Against Objectives**
   Since joining Barclays in August 2024, I have made significant contributions toward driving simplicity, efficiency, and enhancing user experience in various projects:
   - Developed multiple reusable Angular components, such as `app-input`, `app-dropdown`, and `app-toast`, to streamline user interactions and reduce repetitive code, contributing to operational efficiency.
   - Focused on building a flexible `p-table` wrapper that enabled dynamic data rendering and comparison, thus improving the user experience while dealing with audit data and ensuring better data transparency.
   - Played a crucial role in developing dynamic side navigation and hierarchical data presentation using tree nodes, making data more accessible and intuitive for users.
   - Actively promoted new ideas, such as introducing reasoning benchmarks and more effective validation processes, leading to better problem-solving and innovative approaches in our projects.
   - My efforts align with Barclays' global objectives by improving efficiency, building precision in operations, and always striving for world-class service delivery.

### 2. **What Has Been Done to Manage Risks and Strengthen Controls**
   - Implemented a robust system for data validation using reactive forms in Angular, significantly reducing the likelihood of data entry errors and enhancing data integrity.
   - Developed a comprehensive audit trail mechanism within the `p-table`, enabling precise tracking of changes made by users (maker-checker system) and ensuring accountability for data modifications.
   - Created a reusable validation system across different components, ensuring that any input-related errors are flagged and handled promptly, thus minimizing operational risks.
   - Ensured that all changes to key components are thoroughly tested, and feedback loops are incorporated to continuously improve the quality and reliability of the solutions.
   - The transition to using structured services for API handling in `rda` ensures future readiness, minimizing potential risks related to API integration and data flow management.

These actions have not only improved the efficiency of the processes but also established a strong framework for managing risks and ensuring compliance with Barclays' standards for precision and control.
